Supikoira is Castor’s hybrid rocket project, which was built in 2004-2008, culminating with a successful launch at Rovajärvi military test area in Lapland. Supikoira reached 1822m apogeee, measured from the ground level. Project was implemented together with TUT and many companies. Supikoira held the Finnish hobby rocket altitude record until 2010, when a rocket built by Aalto University / SATS flew to 2,3 km, breaking the previous record by Castor.

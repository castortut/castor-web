In Itikka project 2008-2009 Castor designed and built an inertial measurement device equipped with a camera to a commercial REXUS 5 sounding rocket, which was launched into space at 87km. Itikka measured the rocket’s flight path more accurately than the rocket’s own devices and took the first Finnish pictures from Space. Project was implemented together with companies and TUT and with the Swedish, German and European Space Agencies.
